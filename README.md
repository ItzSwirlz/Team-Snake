# Team Snake
 
Team Snake is a Discord bot written with [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) that allows users to play [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) with one another, using reactions to vote on the next move. High scores are saved, with global leaderboards making it possible for servers to compete for records.
